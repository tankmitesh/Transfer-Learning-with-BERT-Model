# Transfer-Learning-with-BERT-Model

## Data Information :
#### We taken Amazone Food Review Dataset (Text data).
#### Data contains two columns (text, score), and 548411 rows.
#### we will predict product score based on review text data.


## Model :
### BERT : 
#### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a Natural Language Processing Model proposed by researchers at Google Research in 2018. BERT is encoder - decoder architecture model, self-attention from encoder side and attention from decoder size transformer. BERT unsupervied modelwith (base)             contains 110M. 
          
### Transfer Learning : 
##### The reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem is known as transfer learning in machine learning. A machine uses the knowledge learned from a prior assignment to increase prediction about a new task in transfer learning.

#### In this task we generated feature vector of each review content using transfer learning in BERT Model and predict text review score.
